A little spaceship-building exploration game. Sort of like Tiny Dwarf Fortress In Space; or more accurately, a hybrid between RimWorld and FTL. Stuff that is currently implemented:

- A layered mesh-based rendering system that allows for arbitrarily sized mobile structures composed of tiles. Big destructible asteroids!
- A ship editor based around blueprints-- the idea being that if bits of your ship get exploded the blueprint remains and you don't have to redesign the entire thing.
- Prototype power distribution system which feeds energy from generators through a chain of nodes.
- Thrusters, tractor beams and missile launchers. Rotational turret mechanics.
- Movement of ships between "sectors", which are bounded gameplay areas represented on a bigger galaxy map. NPC ships exist on the galaxy map and will pursue their own little agendas.
- Very basic crew AI and pathfinding.
